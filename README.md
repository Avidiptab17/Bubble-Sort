# Bubble-Sort
Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that arranges a list of elements in order by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements. Bubble sort compares each element in a list to the element next to it, swapping their positions if they are out of order. The algorithm repeats this process until the list is fully sorted. Bubble sort is primarily used as an educational tool, but it can be faster than other algorithms when parallel processing is allowed.
