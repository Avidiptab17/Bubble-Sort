# Bubble-Sort
Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that arranges a list of elements in order by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements:  How it works Bubble sort compares each element in a list to the element next to it, swapping their positions if they are out of order. The algorithm repeats this process until the list is fully sorted.
